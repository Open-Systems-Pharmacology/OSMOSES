## Expression Profile in MoBi
- An expression profile is a list of parameter paths and values that define the expression of a protein (relative expression AND initial concentration and all associated parameters)

- Additionaly - also Initial conditions (see [**Initial Conditions (IC) BB**](InitialConditions-BB.md)) for the respective protein.

- Values can be edited by user, but no new entries can be added or existing entries removed.

- New expression profiles can be created in MoBi with the access to the gene expression DB.

- An expression profile can be saved as pkml and loaded as a PV BB in an Extension module.

- An expression profile can be exported to Excel. Two sheets will be created - one for parameter values, one for initial conditions. Only values that are defined by a constant value are exported.
