## Individuals in MoBi
- An Individual is a list of parameter paths and values that define the physiology of an individual.
- Values can be edited by user, but no new entries can be added or existing entries removed
- New individuals can be created in MoBi.

- An individual can be saved as *.pkml and loaded as a PV BB in an extension module. (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/MoBi/issues/1409)
