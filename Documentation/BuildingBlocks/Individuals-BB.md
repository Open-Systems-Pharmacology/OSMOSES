## Individuals in MoBi
- An **Individual** is a list of parameter paths and values that define the physiology of an individual.
- Values can be edited by user, but no new entries can be added or existing entries removed
- New individuals can be created in MoBi.

- An individual can be saved as *.pkml and loaded as a PV BB in an extension module.
- Parameters that are defined in the Individual but are not present in the spatial structure are created during simulation creation.
