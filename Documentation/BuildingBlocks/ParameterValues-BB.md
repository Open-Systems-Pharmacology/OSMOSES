## Parameter Values (PB) Building Block (BB)
- A PV BB is a list of parameter paths/names and values
- Local and global parameters
- For "state variable" parameters, start values are listed (as currently in the PSV BB)
- By default, only values that are different from the default values in the respective BB are listed
- Values can be edited by user, new entries can be added or existing entries removed
- New entries can be added with a dialogue which allows to select from a tree (select Module -> BB and create a tree) or type in the path.

- PV BB can be exported to Excel. Only values that are defined by a constant value are exported.
