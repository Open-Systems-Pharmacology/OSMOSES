To get the full advantage of the new modularization concept with the support of individuals and expression profiles in MoBi, you will require a PBPK model created with PK-Sim V12. For PK-Sim project created with previous version, the project must be re-created from a snapshot. Open your project in PK-Sim V12, export it to snapshot, and then re-load from snapshot (see [documentation](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/importing-exporting-project-data-models#exporting-project-to-snapshot-loading-project-from-snapshot)). After this, all simulations in the project will have the new structure and sending them to MoBi will properly transfer the individuals and expression profiles.
