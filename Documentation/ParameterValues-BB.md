## Parameter Values (PB) Building Block (BB)
- A PV BB is a list of parameter paths and values
- Local and global parameters
- For "state variable" parameters, start values are listed (as currently in the PSV BB)
- By default, only values that are different from the default values in the respective BB are listed
- Values can be edited by user, new entries can be added or existing entries removed
- "Export to pkml": stores a pkml with all required information.
- Load from pkml as a new PV-BB
- Merge from PKML into exisiting PV BB
- Export to excel
- Load from excel

### Extend

### Export from PK-Sim
- Empty?

### Use-cases and solutions
- Change parameter values in an xModule
- Overwrite parameter with formulas
- How to change the "state variable" property of a single parameter? Could this be a property of the PV BB?

   
### Tasks
- Comparison
