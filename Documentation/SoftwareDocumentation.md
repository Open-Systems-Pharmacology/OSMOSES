    - Access to repos, AppVeyor, nuget... whatever
    - Default settings e.g. re-sharper etc
    - Coding standards (update?)
- High-level of code structure - what are the repositories, how are they connected, etc
- How to write unit tests (specific for this software) and WHAT to test
- Code comments - what and how to comment the code
- Data binding (concept)
- Serialization
- Commands
- (Code) entry points for typical workflows in the software (e.g., creating an individual in PK-Sim... Where to put the breakpoint to start debugging?)
- Naming standards?
